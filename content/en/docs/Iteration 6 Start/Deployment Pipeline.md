  Continuous Deployment.

Continuous deployment is a strategy in software development where code changes to an application are released automatically into the production environment. In practice, continuous deployment means that a developerâ€™s change to the application could go live within minutes of writing it (assuming it passes automated testing). This is an excellent way to accelerate development and take pressure off the team as there isn't a *ReleaseDay* anymore.

At Onbe we will be using a common way to deploy application code. We have built a unified deployment pipeline for each type of application. Development team needs to call the unified pipeline from their code. Below are the instructions on how to consume the unified pipeline(s) for Service (C#), SPA (Angular) and Shared Library (Nuget) applications. 

### Service (C#) Application
---
This pipeline will be used by all the BFFs and Services that were created following the *CSharp Microservice Project structure and naming guidelines*. 
- Before consuming the pipeline you need to make sure your application is docker enabled. If you application is not docker enabled, right click your application in visual studio and click **Add Container Orchestrator Support** you need to choose orchestrator type Docker Compose and Target OS as Linux.
This will add a docker compose project as well as a docker file to application and fakes.  
{{% pageinfo color="warning" %}}
Note: You need to add Container Orchestrator support for main application as well for all the fakes in your solution.
In future if you add more fakes remember to add container orchestrator support.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

- You also need to add health check to your application. The health check needs to be configured for <font color="red">**```/hc```**</font> route. If health check route /hc is not present then pipeline will not be able to deploy your application. The pipeline is configured to deploy application in Azure Kubernetes cluster with K8s Liveness and Readiness probe pointing to /hc route.

```
 public class Startup
{
    public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
            Configuration = configuration;
    }
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddHealthChecks();   <-------------
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
        app.UseRouting();

        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapControllers();
            endpoints.MapHealthChecks("/hc");  <------------
        });
    }
}
```

- Add Github deployment pipeline
    1. Create a ```.github/workflows``` directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.
    2. In the ```.github/workflows``` directory, create a file named ```deploment.yml```. For more information, see ["Creating new files."](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/creating-new-files)
    3. Copy the below YAML contents into the ```deploment.yml``` file.
        - Change the value for **APP_NAME** parameter to the name of your application. (e.g. OmOrderApprovalSvc)
        - Change the value of **PACT_PACTICIPANT** parameter to the name of your repository. (e.g. om-orderapproval-svc)
        - If your application contains the provider pact test is verifying the pact consumer contracts then change the value to true.
        - You don't need to change any value for secrets or add any secrets. Secrets will be handled by devops team.

### SPA (Angular) Application
This pipeline will be used by all the Frontend (Single Page Application) Angular applications.
