## Our goals for this section

Some of these we can check off right now.

|   | Our goals | Notes
|---|---|---
| ☑ | Our microservice does not share a database | **That's easy; frontend microservices don't have databases.**
| ☐ | Our microservice is independently deployable | 
|  | ☐ All required resources present | 
|  | ☐ All required providers ready | 
|  | ☑ Does not break its consumers | **That's easy; frontend microservices don't have consumers.**
|  | ☐ Does not deploy in lock-step with any other microservices | 
| ☐ | Our microservice is independently testable | 
|  | ☐ It tests its own behavior | 
|  | ☐ Testing doesn't require other microservices to be running | 
|  | ☐ It doesn't test the behavior of other microservices | 

We'll be revisiting this list as we check off items.

## TODO

TODO: Make sure all other instances of this table match.
