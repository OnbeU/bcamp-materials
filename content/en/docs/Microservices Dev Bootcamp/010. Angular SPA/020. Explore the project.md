### package.json, package-lock.json and node_modules/

{{% alert title="What is package.json?" color="primary" %}}
The package. json file is the heart of any Node project. It records important metadata about a project which is required before publishing to NPM, and also defines functional attributes of a project that npm uses to install dependencies, run scripts, and identify the entry point to our package.

â€” [What Is package.json? | heynode.com](https://heynode.com/tutorial/what-packagejson/)
{{% /alert %}}

Our `package.json` is a very basic version, so far.

`node_modules/` contains libraries downloaded from npm

`package-lock.json` helps keep track of the files in `node_modules/`.

Before you do anything else, do:

~~~
npm update
~~~

Now try out some of the scripts in `package.json`, such as:

~~~
npm run start
npm run build
npm run test
~~~
