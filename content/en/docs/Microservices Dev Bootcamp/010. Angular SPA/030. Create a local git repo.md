## Pick some short paths

We suggest `c:\src\dii\.` as the directory in which to put the code for all of your
Drive-Ins Inc.
projects.

The first microservice you'll create is the Angular frontend for
Drive-Ins Inc's administrative app.

We suggest `c:\src\dii\dii_admin_fe\.` as the directory for that
microservice's code.

Following our naming guidelines
{TODO: link to the naming guidelines}
our Azure Devops repo will be named `dii_administration_frontend`.
But for the local repo you don't want the path to the project to be super long
because later we'll be using 
[some tools from Pact](https://github.com/pact-foundation)
which use Ruby and for some reason Ruby on Windows 10 has a 260 character limit for path names.

So we don't want to use, say,
`C:\Users\jsmith\source\repos\dii_administration_frontend\.`

## Open VS Code in the local directory and start a powershell terminal
Start a command prompt.

```
md c:\src\dii\dii_admin_fe
code c:\src\dii\dii_admin_fe
```
Start a terminal (powershell).

## Initialize the local git repo

Remember to use `main` and not `master`.

~~~
git init --initial-branch=main
~~~

## Create a README.md

~~~
echo "Fill in this README" > README.md
~~~

## Commit to origin

That's as much work as you'll ever want to do directly on `main`. Stage and commit with the message "Added README.md".

TODO: Provide instructions on creating a branch and how to name it.
