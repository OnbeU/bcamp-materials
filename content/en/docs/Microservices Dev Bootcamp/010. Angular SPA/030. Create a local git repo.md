## Your team number

Your instructor will have given you your team number and a link
to your team's repositories.

In the examples that follow, we'll assume you're on team 000.

## Clone it

From the repo list that your instructor gave you:

 - Copy the repo path into the clipboard.
   Example: `https://github.com/OnbeU/bc000-theatermanagement-spa.git`

In Visual Studio Code:

 - `Ctrl + Shift + P` to show commands.
 - Type **Git: Clone** and hit **Enter**.
 - Paste the repo path.
   Example: `https://github.com/OnbeU/bc000-theatermanagement-spa.git`
 - Choose the target directory `C:\src\onbe\`

{{% alert title="Why so short?" color="info" %}}
Why have a short path like, `C:\src\onbe\bc000-theatermanagement-spa\`, instead of the
longer path that Visual Studio (not-Code) defaults to, like
`C:\Users\jsmith\source\repos\bc000_theatermanagement_frontend\`?

Because later we'll be using 
[some tools from Pact](https://github.com/pact-foundation)
which use Ruby and for some reason Ruby on Windows 10 has a 260 character limit for path names.
