## Create a branch

`feature/us-202107171725-angular-setup`

## Generate the Angular app in the ./ directory

~~~
npx -p @angular/cli ng new --directory=./ --routing=true --style=scss project
~~~

Let's break down that command line.
 - `npx -p @angular/cli ng` tells `npm` to
   - Create a `package.json` file for your package
   - Install the Angular CLI tool into that package
   - Call the Angular CLI `ng` tool once it's installed
 - `ng new` tells the Angular CLI to create a new app
   - `--directory=./` is the location of the app (and the `package.json`)
   -  `--routing=true` means we want Angular Routing
   -  `--style=scss` means we want to use SCSS for style
      (because [SCSS is better](https://www.mugo.ca/Blog/7-benefits-of-using-SASS-over-conventional-CSS))
   -  `project` is the name that will be added to `package.json`.
      We use the name `project` in all of our Angular apps so the directory names will be
      consistent and our pipeline will be able to find them.

Stage and commit to local feature branch with comment "ng new".

Add these lines to `project.json`:

~~~
{
  ...
  "description": "Drive-Ins Inc. Administration Frontend",
  ...
  "author": "Drive-Ins Inc.",
  "private": true,
  "license": "UNLICENSED",
  ...
}
~~~


{{% alert title="This is not open source" color="info" %}}
Why we use "private" and "UNLICENSED"?

Because this is not open-source software. It's copyrighted stuff.
{{% /alert %}}

Stage and commit to local feature branch with comment "Updated package.json".

## Explore the new app

Let's take a look at what `ng` has created for us.

### Continuously-running unit tests

In VS Code, start a new Terminal and name it "karma".

Fire up the [Karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma) test runner to continuously
run your unit tests in a browser window.

~~~
npm test
~~~

TODO: Discuss how we'll keep this browser window open during development.

### Browse the continuously-updated app

In VS Code, start a new Terminal and name it "angular".

Start the app

~~~
npm start
~~~

Now open a browser window and navigate to the app.

TODO: Discuss how we'll keep this browser window open during development.

## Pull request time!
