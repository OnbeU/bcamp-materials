  Configure the Terminals Manager extension so VS Code will set up all of those Terminals for you.
---

Don't feel like committing all of these commands to memory and setting up VS Code's Terminal
sessions to be *just so*?

~~~
npm run test
npm run start
swa start http://localhost:4200 --api fake-backend
~~~

Try the **Terminals Manager** extension.

## Install Terminals Manager

If you haven't done so already, install the
[Terminals Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-terminals)
extension for VS Code.

## Configure Terminals Manager

Follow the instructions at the
[Terminals Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-terminals)
site (which are basically, "Hit F1 and choose `Terminals: Edit Configuration`)
to configure **Terminal Manager**.

Use the following configuration for the commands you'll be using most in bootcamp:

.vscode\terminals.json
~~~
{
  "autorun": false,
  "terminals": [
    {
    },
    {
      "name": "Karma",
      "execute": false,
      "command": "npm run test"
    },
    {
      "name": "Angular",
      "execute": false,
      "command": "npm start"
    },
    {
      "name": "Static Web App CLI",
      "execute": false,
      "command": "swa start http://localhost:4200 --api fake-backend"
    }
  ]
}
~~~

Now whenever you want to open those Terminal sessions windows, just hit F1, choose `Terminals: Run`
and those Terminal sessions will start, prepopulated with the commands you want and ready for you to 
hit Enter.
