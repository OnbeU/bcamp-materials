### Add the page

~~~
npx ng generate component areas/about/pages/about
~~~

...which may be abbreviated to...

~~~
npx ng g c areas/about/pages/about
~~~

At this point we'd inspect the changes made to:

~~~
app.module.ts
TODO: List the others
~~~

Commit with comment "ng g c about"

Add the routing stuff to ``:

~~~
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';

import { AboutComponent } from './areas/about/pages/about/about.component';
...

const routes: Routes = [
  {path: '' , component: DashboardComponent  },
  {path: 'about', component: AboutComponent },
  ...
];
...
~~~

Add the link to the header in `src\app\areas\app\header\header.component.html`:

~~~
...
      <div class="navbar-nav flex-grow-1">
        <a class="nav-link text-light bg-primary" routerLink="/movies">Movies</a>
        <a class="nav-link text-light bg-primary" routerLink="/about">About</a>
      </div>
...
~~~
