This approach came from
Frederik Prijck's
[Runtime environment configuration with Angular](https://www.thisdot.co/blog/runtime-environment-configuration-with-angular).
{{% /alert %}}

## Overview

We're going to create a service, `ConfigService`, which:
- Uses an `HttpClient`.
- Reads, at runtime, configuration values in this order:
    1. From the Angular environment file.
    2. (If present, overriding the above:) From the config.json file.

The file `assets/config.json` will be kept under source control 
and will initially contain no properties, which means that
when debugging all properties will be read from `src/environments/environment.ts`.

The pipeline will entirely replace the default `config.json` file when the app is staged or deployed.

## Install Spectator

Why **Spectator**? From their 
[README.md](https://github.com/ngneat/spectator):

> Spectator helps you get rid of all the boilerplate grunt work, leaving you with readable, sleek and streamlined unit tests.

Install **Spectator**:
~~~
npm install @ngneat/spectator --save-dev
~~~

Commit with comment "npm install @ngneat/spectator --save-dev"

## assets/config.json

Create `assets/config.json`.
~~~
{
}
~~~

Commit with comment "assets/config.json"

## ConfigService and Config class

Generate some code. Note that our `Config` class is a just a DTO and doesn't need
automated tests, so we use the `--skip-tests=true` option.

~~~
npx ng generate class core/singleton-services/config/config --skip-tests=true
npx ng generate service core/singleton-services/config/config
~~~

Inspect the changes made to:

~~~
src\app\core\singleton-services\config\config.service.ts
src\app\core\singleton-services\config\config.ts
src\app\core\singleton-services\config\config.service.spec.ts
~~~

Commit with comment "ng g class & service config config"

## Write tests first

TODO: Add the test stuff.

## Implement

Edit `config.ts`:
~~~
export class Config {
  apiBaseUrl: string | undefined;
}
~~~

Edit `config.service.ts`:

~~~
/*
  Accessor for configuration properties.

  Loads properties in this order:
    1. From the Angular environment file ().
    2. (If present, overriding the above:) From the config.json file.

  The AppModule (see src\app\app.module.ts) loads this service as part
  of APPINITIALIZER, ensuring the application isn't started before the
  config settings are loaded.

 */

import { HttpClient } from "@angular/common/http";
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";

import { environment } from './../../../../environments/environment';
import { Config } from "./config";

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class ConfigService {
  envName: string;
  apiBaseUrl: string;
  production: boolean;

  constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) {
    // 1. From the Angular environment file.
    const environmentAny: any = environment;
    this.envName = environmentAny.envName;
    this.production = environmentAny.production;
    this.apiBaseUrl = environmentAny.apiBaseUrl;
  }

  loadConfig() {
    return this.httpClient
      .get<Config>('./assets/config.json')
      .toPromise()
      .then(config => {
        // 2. (If present, overriding the above:) From the config.json file.
        const configAny: any = config;

        if (configAny.envName != undefined) {
          this.production = configAny.production;
        }
        if (configAny.envName != undefined) {
          this.envName = `${configAny.envName}`;
        }
        if (config.apiBaseUrl != undefined) {
          this.apiBaseUrl = `${config.apiBaseUrl}`;
        }
      });
  }
}
~~~

Notice that you now have a failing test. That's because `config.service.spec.ts`
doesn't know yet how to provide the `HttpClient`.

Add an `HttpClientTestingModule` to the `imports` in `config.service.spec.ts` like this:
~~~
  beforeEach(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      imports: [HttpClientTestingModule]
    });
    service = TestBed.inject(ConfigService);
  });
~~~

Now your tests should be happy again.

Update `src/app/app.module.ts`:

~~~
...
import { ConfigService } from './core/singleton-services/config/config.service';
import { APP_INITIALIZER } from '@angular/core';

export const configFactory = (configService: ConfigService) => {
  return () => configService.loadConfig();
};
...
providers: [
    {
      // Loading ConfigService as part of APPINITIALIZER
      // ensures the application isn't started before the
      // config settings are loaded.
      provide: APP_INITIALIZER,
      useFactory: configFactory,
      deps: [ConfigService],
      multi: true
    },
...
~~~

## Deploy

Commit with comment "ConfigService"

Push, create a pull request, complete the pull request and delete the branches.
