## TODO: Find a place for this

Note that we've now got a failing test.

TODO: Include a screen shot.

{{% alert title="Don't get in the habit of doing what we're about to do" color="warning" %}}
To fix this problem we're simply going to remove the particular automated test.

THIS WOULD NORMALLY BE A TERRIBLE THING TO DO!

In your normal development process, if you encounter a failed test you wouldn't just remove the test.

But it's okay to do it in this
case because we'll soon be replacing all of the protractor tests and replacing them with cucumber.

But, seriously, don't get in this habit.
{{% /alert %}}

Remove these lines from `src\app\app.component.spec.ts`:

~~~
  it('should render title', () => {
    const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent);
    fixture.detectChanges();
    const compiled = fixture.nativeElement as HTMLElement;
    expect(compiled.querySelector('.content span')?.textContent).toContain('project app is running!');
  });
~~~

Save those changes (`Ctrl + s`) and watch how Karma is now happy.

TODO: Insert screen shot.
