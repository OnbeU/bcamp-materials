### Static Web Apps CLI start

~~~
swa start http://localhost:4200 --api fake-backend
~~~


### Add the movie list

~~~
npx ng generate component areas/movies/pages/movie-list
~~~

...which may be abbreviated to...

~~~
npx ng g c areas/movies/pages/movie-list
~~~

At this point we'd inspect the changes made to:

~~~
app.module.ts
src\app\areas\movies\pages\movie-list\movie-list.component.html
src\app\areas\movies\pages\movie-list\movie-list.component.scss
src\app\areas\movies\pages\movie-list\movie-list.component.spec.ts
src\app\areas\movies\pages\movie-list\movie-list.component.ts
~~~

Commit with comment "ng g c movie-list"

Edit `src\app\app-routing.module.ts`

~~~
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { DashboardComponent } from './areas/dashboard/pages/dashboard/dashboard.component';
import { PageNotFoundComponent } from './areas/404/pages/page-not-found/page-not-found.component';
import { MovieListComponent } from './areas/movies/pages/movie-list/movie-list.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  {path: '' , component: DashboardComponent  },
  {path: '404', component: PageNotFoundComponent},
  {path: 'movies', component: MovieListComponent},
  {path: '**', redirectTo: '/404'}

];
@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
~~~

Commit with comment "Movie list page appears"

### Backend service

~~~
npx ng generate service core/singleton-services/backend/backend
npx ng generate class core/singleton-services/backend/movie
npx ng generate service core/singleton-services/backend/movies-cache
~~~

...which may be abbreviated to...

~~~
npx ng g service core/singleton-services/backend/backend
npx ng g class core/singleton-services/backend/movie
npx ng g service core/singleton-services/backend/movies-cache
~~~

At this point we'd inspect the changes made to:

~~~
src\app\core\singleton-services\backend\backend.service.spec.ts
src\app\core\singleton-services\backend\backend.service.ts
src\app\core\singleton-services\backend\movie.spec.ts
src\app\core\singleton-services\backend\movie.ts
src\app\core\singleton-services\backend\movies-cache.service.spec.ts
src\app\core\singleton-services\backend\movies-cache.service.ts
~~~

Commit with comment "ng g service service backend, ng g class movie, ng g service service movies-cache"


TODO: There's just a mess of changes that I put into the `bcfinal-theatermanagement-spa` microservice. Go there and look at them. Especially:

~~~
src\app\areas\movies\pages\movie-list\*
src\app\core\singleton-services\backend\*
src\environments\*
~~~
