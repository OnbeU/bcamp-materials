## Create a branch

`feature/us-202107171752-ui-customization`

## Install bootstrap and bootswatch

You'll install:
  - [ng-bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io)
  - bootstrap
  - bootswatch

{{% alert title="Credit where credit is due" color="info" %}}
This approach came from R & R Engineering's
[Adding Bootstrap and Bootswatch to Angular.CLI](http://randreng.com/adding-bootsrap-and-bootswatch-to-angular-cli/).
{{% /alert %}}

~~~
npm install @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap bootstrap bootswatch
~~~

## Create ./project/src/_variables.scss

In the src directory add a new file `_variables.scss`. This file will hold all
of the scss variables for the entire project. This file can be referenced by
any and all component level scss files to get the values for colors and font
and such. By reference this file in the component level scss files, we will
have access to all the theme variables keeping styles consistent. This will
limit the number of places we will need to change if we change themes in the
future.

~~~
echo '@import "../node_modules/bootswatch/dist/superhero/_variables";' > .\src\_variables.scss
~~~

## Edit ./src/style.scss

~~~
@import "./variables"; 
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap"; 
@import "../node_modules/bootswatch/dist/superhero/bootswatch";
~~~

## Pull request time!
