also include some info for you Mac/Linux people, but mostly
you're on your own.

## Software you'll need

### Visual Studio Code

 - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - Confirm with `code --version`
   - Extension: [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github)
   - Extension: [Azure Static Web Apps](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurestaticwebapps)
   - Extension: [Azure Functions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions)
   - Extension: [Terminals Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-terminals)

### nvm, node and npm

We're going to run a specific version of `node`. (See the next section, "Switch node to version 12.22.4".)

Since you might want to run other versions
of `node` on other projects, we're going to use `nvm`, the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
to make it easy to switch between versions.

Before proceeding, check to see if you already have `nvm` installed by running this command:

~~~
nvm version
~~~

If it tells you a version number, you've already got `nvm` which means you've got `node` and `npm` as well,
so you can skip to the next section, "Switch node to version 12.22.4".

As you perform the steps below you'll be instructed to fully remove `node` from your system before
installing `nvm-windows`. Here are some suggestions that will help you make sure you fully remove everything:

 1. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20711240/how-to-completely-remove-node-js-from-windows
 2. Don't forget Windows uninstall.
 3. Be sure to check these locations:
~~~
C:\Program Files\nodejs
C:\Program Files (x86)\Nodejs
C:\Program Files\Nodejs
C:\Users\{User}\AppData\Roaming\npm (or %appdata%\npm)
C:\Users\{User}\AppData\Roaming\npm-cache (or %appdata%\npm-cache)
C:\Users\{User}\.npmrc (and possibly check for that without the . prefix too)
C:\Users\{User}\AppData\Local\Temp\npm-*
%appdata%\..\local\temp\npm*
~~~
