## Should Pact tests be red first?

## How do we know we’re written enough tests (especially since J.R. says he doesn’t like a quota % for code coverage)?

## Who’s writing the Gherkins?

## How do we know we’re writing the tests correctly?

## Difference between acc tests written in Gherkin format for user story and the ones that could be applied to the actual ms?

## How do we tie a Gherkin in code to a Feature in ADO?

Needs more discussion and planning. Maybe we should just revisit this after we get some more experience.

## What if a Feature in ADO needs to be tied to Gherkins in several microservices?

Needs more discussion and planning. Maybe we should just revisit this after we get some more experience.

## Where will we save documentation?

Needs more discussion and planning.

## Prod Release process

## What about giving clients keys to a non-production version of our APIs and such?

Can be solved with synthetic users.

## Will we standardize response objects, paths and such for APIs?

## Will we transfer the bootcamp materials into Confluence or something like that?

## Should a Pact verification failure prevent the PR from being created?

Needs more discussion.

## Does PO have to be available for every PR approval?

Needs more discussion. Maybe we should just revisit this after we get some more experience.

## Does QA have to be available for every PR approval?

Needs more discussion. Maybe we should just revisit this after we get some more experience.

## Do we plan to have a centralized way of cataloging/tracking all the different microservices (such as Ortelius)?

Yes. Needs more discussion.

## Will we use synthetic behavior for our early-access clients?

Needs more discussion. Maybe we should just revisit this after we get some more experience.

## BFFs keeping data?

On a case-by-case basis, maybe. Probably keep it using Dapr state instead of a database.

## Sidecar to BFF to other service?

Yes.
